# AWS Technical Professional

## Intro :

- AWS : Amazon web service
- POC : Proof of concept
- APN : AWS Partner Network


## AWS Core Technologies :

+    ### Cloud :

        In contast with On-Premises IT, the user will access ressources ( apps/ database/ server / storage ... ) throught the internet. 

+    ### Cloud computing :

        It's an on demand delivery of compute power, database, storage,.. via the internet with pay as you go pricing.
    
+    ### Advantage of cloud computing :
    
        1. Variable expense : 
        only pay for what the customer consumes when they need to.
        2. Benefit from massive economy of scale : 
        AWS achieves heigher economy of scale -> lower pay as you go prices.
        3. guessing capacity : 
        Eliminates guessing on infrastructure capacity needs, no idle ressouce waiting, ressources in cloud computing can scale according to the demand.
        4. Speed and agility :
        New IT ressources are available within minutes.
        5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining infrastructure.
        6. Deploy globally (multiple regions) in minutes.
 
        > :information_source: AWS offers a huge range of features and services to help customers achieve their goals.
        
        
+    ### AWS Global Infrastructure :

        -    AWS Regions:

                AWS cloud computing ressources are hosted in multiple locations called **AWS regions**. 
                Each region is **completly isolated** -> great fault tolerance and stability -> increased [resiliency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilience_(network)). 
                
                > Ressources **are only viewable withtin the region**, no ressources are replicated automatically across regions.

        -    Availibility zone (AZ):
        
                Seperated geographic area with multiple isolated locations. All AZ are interconnected with high bandwidth low latency fully [redundent fiber](https://blog.ospinsight.com/the-importance-of-fiber-network-redundancy) 

                > Deploying on  multiple AZ in the same region improves the availability.

        -    Points of Presence (POP):
        
                Edge locations and regional Edge cache servers are used by Amazon CloudFront to deliver data, video, apps and APS with low latency transfer speed.
